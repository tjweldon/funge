# Funge

This is a golang implementation of [Befunge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge), an esoteric programming language.

The intent of this project is largely just for fun(ge).

As of writing this, the project is very much still under construction.

## Goals

 - Implement the interpreter instructions per the befunge 93 spec.
 - Implement a visual mode that animates the execution of a befunge program.
 - Possibly extend to funge 98 and beyond...
